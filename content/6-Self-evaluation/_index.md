### Internship Overview

During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from **September 8 to December 9, 2024**, I had the invaluable opportunity to transform from a traditional backend developer into a cloud-native engineer.

I served as a **Backend Developer** for the **Bandup IELTS Learning Platform** - a comprehensive AI-powered application. My primary focus was building a robust, scalable backend infrastructure using **Java Spring Boot**, integrating it deeply with AWS services to handle automated Writing and Speaking evaluations and intelligent study material generation.

### Key Achievements

Through this project, I significantly advanced my expertise in:

**Java Spring Boot & Cloud-Native Development:**
- **RESTful API Design:** Developed and documented complex REST APIs using **Spring Web** to serve frontend requests and orchestrate AI workflows.
- **Data Persistence:** Implemented efficient data access layers using **Spring Data JPA/Hibernate** with Amazon RDS and DynamoDB.
- **Security:** Integrated **Spring Security** with AWS services for robust authentication and authorization.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Built event-driven features using **Spring Boot Messaging** to consume and produce messages via **Amazon SQS**, ensuring decoupling between user requests and heavy AI processing tasks.

**Cloud Architecture & AWS Integration:**
- **Containerization:** Dockerized Spring Boot applications and managed deployments using **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)** and **AWS Fargate** for serverless container execution.
- **AWS SDK for Java:** Successfully integrated the AWS SDK to programmatically interact with services like **Amazon S3** (storage), **ElastiCache (Redis)** (caching), and **Amazon Bedrock**.
- **Serverless Integration:** Orchestrated workflows where the Java backend triggers AWS Lambda functions for specific micro-tasks.

**AI/ML Integration (Backend Perspective):**
- **Orchestration:** Designed the backend logic to act as the central hub, routing user audio/text data to **Google Gemini API** and **Amazon Bedrock** and processing the returned analysis.
- **Cost Optimization Logic:** Implemented backend logic to optimize token usage and API calls (achieving ~72% cost savings).
- **Vector Database Interaction:** Managed integration with Vector Stores for RAG pipelines using Java clients.

### Work Ethics

Throughout my internship, I consistently strived to:
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented Java code following industry standards.
- Follow AWS Well-Architected Framework principles for security and reliability.
- Actively communicate with mentors to bridge the gap between application logic and infrastructure.
- Ensure thorough testing (Unit Testing with JUnit/Mockito) before deployment.

### Gratitude

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to:
- My mentors at AWS for guiding me on how to build enterprise-grade cloud applications.
- The team for their support in integrating the backend with AI services.
- AWS for providing the infrastructure to learn and practice modern cloud development.

This internship has been a transformative experience, bridging the gap between my academic Java knowledge and real-world Cloud Native development. I am confident that these skills will be the foundation of my future career as a Backend Cloud Engineer.
