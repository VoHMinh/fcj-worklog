### Internship Overview

During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from **September 8 to December 9, 2024**, I had the invaluable opportunity to learn, practice, and apply my academic knowledge to a real-world cloud computing environment.

I participated in building the **Bandup IELTS Learning Platform** - a comprehensive AI-powered application that helps students prepare for IELTS exams through automated Writing and Speaking evaluations, as well as intelligent Flashcard generation from study materials.
